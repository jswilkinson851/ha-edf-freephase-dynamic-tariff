# 📊 EDF FreePhase Dynamic Tariff — Dashboard Examples (v0.7.1)

This folder contains Lovelace dashboard examples designed to help you visualise
the EDF FreePhase Dynamic tariff, cost engine, event platform, and diagnostic
data in a clear, actionable way.

These dashboards are optional, but they provide an excellent starting point for
building your own energy‑aware Home Assistant UI.

## 📂 Included Dashboards

### **overall_dashboard.yaml**
A full, multi‑section dashboard that brings together:

- Coordinator health and diagnostic metadata  
- Current and next tariff slot information  
- Phase windows and block summaries  
- Cheapest and most expensive slots in the next 24 hours  
- Daily summaries (yesterday, today, tomorrow)  
- Cost and consumption breakdowns (by phase and by slot)  
- Live scheduler timing (refresh delay, jitter, next refresh)  
- Debug logging controls  
- Advanced diagnostic attributes  
- Event diagnostics (NEW in v0.7.0)  

This is the most complete view of the integration and works beautifully on
tablets, desktops, or wall‑mounted displays.

## 🧩 How to Use These Dashboards

1. Open any `.yaml` file in this folder.  
2. Copy the contents.  
3. In Home Assistant, go to:  
   **Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Edit Dashboard → Raw Configuration Editor**  
4. Paste the YAML into a new view or a new dashboard.  
5. Save and adjust entity IDs if needed.

Most dashboards rely on:

- `sensor.edf_fpd_diagnostic`  
- `sensor.edf_fpd_cost_coordinator_status`  
- `sensor.edf_fpd_current_price`  
- `sensor.edf_fpd_current_slot_colour`  
- `sensor.edf_fpd_next_slot_price`  
- `sensor.edf_fpd_today_phases_summary`  
- `sensor.edf_fpd_tomorrow_phases_summary`  
- `event.edf_fpd_tariff_slot_phase_events`  

If you have renamed entities, update them accordingly.

## 💡 Tips for Customisation

- You can rearrange sections or collapse them using `expander-card`.  
- Add your own solar, battery, or EV sensors to extend the dashboard.  
- Combine this with your `/automations` examples for a full energy workflow.  
- Screenshots can be added to `/examples/screenshots` if you want to showcase layouts.

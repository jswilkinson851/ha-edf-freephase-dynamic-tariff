# 🔔 Tariff Slot & Phase Events

As of **v0.7.0**, this integration includes a full **event platform** that emits structured Home Assistant events whenever EDF’s dynamic tariff changes in a meaningful way.

These events allow you to build automations that react instantly to:
- slot changes  
- phase changes (green/amber/red)  
- block transitions  
- next‑phase predictions  
- tariff window boundaries

# 📡 Event Entity (UPDATED in v0.7.1)

### `event.edf_fpd_tariff_slot_phase_events`

This entity emits all tariff‑related events and exposes diagnostic attributes:

- `last_event_type`
- `last_event_timestamp`
- `event_counts`
- `event_history`

Friendly name:

- `EDF FPD Tariff Slot & Phase Events`

# 🧙‍♂️ Event Types

All event types follow the naming convention:

- `edf_fpd_<description>`


The following events may be emitted:

| `edf_fpd_slot_changed` | The current half‑hour slot changed. |
| `edf_fpd_phase_changed` | The tariff phase (green/amber/red) changed. |
| `edf_fpd_phase_started` | A new phase window began. |
| `edf_fpd_phase_ended` | A phase window ended. |
| `edf_fpd_phase_block_changed` | The merged block (group of same‑colour slots) changed. |
| `edf_fpd_next_phase_changed` | The predicted next phase changed. |
| `edf_fpd_next_green_phase_changed` | The next green phase changed. |
| `edf_fpd_next_amber_phase_changed` | The next amber phase changed. |
| `edf_fpd_next_red_phase_changed` | The next red phase changed. |
| `edf_fpd_debug` | Debug event stream (only when debug logging is enabled). |

# 📦 Event Payload Structure

Each event includes a structured JSON payload.  
Example:

```json
{
  "event_type": "edf_fpd_phase_changed",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-25T20:00:03.050683+00:00",
  "phase": "amber",
  "from": {
    "phase": "green",
    "start": "19:30"
  },
  "to": {
    "phase": "amber",
    "start": "20:00"
